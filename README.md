# HyperionDev-Capstone4
Update of HyperionDev Capstone 3 Project
Create a functional “Save for later” page for the website, where users can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. in a personal folder to be
able to go back and see them later.
○ Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to “Save for later”.
○ When an item is added, an alert should tell the user how many items are in their “Save for later” folder.
○ Create a new HTML page for the “Save for later” section, which allows the user to see what is in their folder.
○ Create a form which allows a user to leave comments.
○ Create forms to allow a user to “like” an item/article/etc.
○ Create forms for if a person would like to contact you.
○ Within the entirety of the site, have at least the following jQuery functionality:
■ A function which contains hiding/showing.
■ A drop-down menu.
■ Animation effects.
■ A function with chained effects.
